If you got error bit times, go to python official site and click on download https://www.python.org/downloads/

this will dowload executable file (windows/mac) ,if you are on linux simply do 
> sudo apt-get install python3.8


#### 2. Understand the logic of python development

- Packages 
- Environment



#### 3. Install Environment (Conda)
Head over to Anaconda official download page https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual and install it. 

Once, installation is done, if you are on mac/linux, you will see `(base)` written in your terminal , if you are on windows, go to search bar and look for conda terminal

Read more about conda environment creation, sharing, etc. at https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html


#### 4. Create environment
For this workshop, we'll create an environment with name `foss4env` and then we'll install whatever package we need inside this

First pakcage we'll be working with is `notebook` . Jupyter notebooks are interactive way for us to write python code in the browser directly.
<b> Creatig env </b> 
Open Conda command prompt for windows or normal terminal  on mac/linux, and create environment using following command

`conda create -n foss4env Python==3.6` , once created , activate the environment using `conda activate foss4env` by doing this you can see the `(base)` will change to `(foss4env)`

#### 5. Installing package

Now we can install package `pip install notebook`, everytime we want to install any package, we'll be running similar command

#### 6. Running jupyter notebook

After package in installed, simply start the notebook by typing `jupyter notebook`
